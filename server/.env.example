#
# --- Allowed Referrers ---
#
# Controls which websites (referrers) are allowed to access this application.
# This acts as an allow-list, blocking any request that doesn't have a 'Referer'
# header matching one of the URLs below.
#
# * Format: A comma-separated list of URLs.
# * DO NOT use spaces between URLs.
# * This check uses 'startsWith', so an entry for 'https://app.com' will
#   also match 'https://app.com/page1'.
#
# WARNING: This is NOT a high-security feature. The 'Referer' header can be
# easily faked (spoofed) by an attacker. Use this only to prevent
# casual hotlinking, not to protect sensitive data.
#
# CRITICAL: If this variable is empty or unset, NO referrers are allowed,
# and ALL requests will be blocked with a 403 Forbidden error.
#
# Example (Production):
# ALLOWED_REFERRERS="https://production-app.com"
#
# Example (Production, Staging, and Local Dev):
# ALLOWED_REFERRERS="https://app.com,https://staging.app.com,http://localhost:3000"
#
ALLOWED_REFERRERS="https://production-app.com"
#
# --- Admin Token Expiration ---
#
# Controls token lifetime for users with 'admin_privilege'.
#
# * To set a specific duration: Use a string like "15m" or "1h".
# * To use the default (1 year): Set to "null" OR "" (empty string) OR comment out the line.
#
# (The code automatically provides a '1y' default if no valid duration is set)
#
ADMIN_TOKEN_EXPIRATION="null"

#
# --- Customer Token Expiration ---
#
# Controls token lifetime for regular (non-admin) customers.
#
# * To set a specific duration: Use a string like "2h" or "7d".
# * To use the default (2 hours): Set to "null" OR "" (empty string) OR comment out the line.
#
# (The code automatically provides a '2h' default if no valid duration is set)
#
CUSTOMER_TOKEN_EXPIRATION="2h"
